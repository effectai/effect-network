No variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is agreed by the
High Guard. Any variation agreed between the Parties, published on the
Blockchain and communicated to Members by notice, shall bind Members of the
EffectDAO.

Upon request of or notification by the EffectDAO High Guard, and from time to
time, Member shall immediately provide information and documents that the
EffectDAO High Guard, in its or their sole discretion, deems necessary to comply
with the laws, regulations, rules or agreements of or in relation to any

(“Party Termination Event”) on the Blockchain operated on by The Effect Network,

continue to be in force on or after a Party Termination Event in relation to the
respective DAO Member shall remain in full force and effect. EffectDAO High
Guard may, upon Proposal and successful Vote, strip Membership from a Party for
cause. A cause is given, where the EffectDAO finds that the EffectDAO Member:

  applicable laws, or
- Is guilty of conduct which, in the opinion of the High Guard is likely to have
  a serious effect on the EffectDAO.
- Such actions that result in the Member being forcefully removed from the
  EffectDAO will be recorded on the Blockchain that The Effect Network and the
  EffectDAO operate on.

form a decentralized autonomous organization. Each Party confirms:

- Is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person
- Is liable for its own taxes
- The Parties have no fiduciary duties or equivalent obligations towards each
  other.

If the Foundational Code, the Effect Staking Protocol, the Effect Dashboard, and
Proposal system and Voting are affected, hindered, or made impossible in whole
or in part by a Force Majeure Event, this shall under no circumstances be deemed
a breach of this Agreement and no loss or damage shall be claimed by reason
thereof.

EffectDAO participants may not assign or transfer any of their rights or duties
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to a third party. Any such
assignment or transfer shall be void and shall not impose any obligation or
liability on the Parties to the assignee or transferee.

duties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to any of their
affiliates or in connection with a merger or other disposition of all or
substantially all of their assets.
