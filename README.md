<p align="center">The Future-of-Work</p>

Join us in creating the decentralized network for human intelligence! Effect is
focused on creating a distributed workforce where workers and requesters can
easily connect with each other. Where the interactions are managed by smart
contracts and policies are instituted by the community. Be part of building the
Future-of-Work.

## 🤷🏽‍♀️ Why?

We believe in the power of communities to govern themselves. At Effect the
community determines fair and just policies, set on the blockchain, that define
the relationship between workers and requesters. Effect Network is a place where
people can work from anywhere at any time without fear of being exploited. There
is still a lot that needs to be done. Help us build the tools and infrastructure
that will further carry the digital working class into the future.
