## Becoming a DAO member

To participate in the EffectDAO you must fist become a member. This can be done
by signing the constitution on [the Effect
Dashboard](https://dashboard.effect.ai/dao). As a member you will be able to
post new proposals to the DAO and vote on existing proposals.

### The constitution

The constitution is a set of rules that binds all members of the DAO. When you
sign the constitution your signature is stored on the blockchain which shows
you're a member. The latest version of the constitution can be [found
here](https://github.com/effectai/effect-network-eos/blob/156f0f78cbce9f8f36fb8707285056cc800e25d3/constitution/constitution.md). If
the constitution is updated in a significant way it's required to re-sign it
from the dashboard.

### Vote weight

Ranks are no longer part of EffectDAO after the implementation of [Propsosal
22](https://dao.effect.network/proposals/22).
{: .warn}

Your vote weight is determined by your staked NFX and EFX Power:

```
Vote weight = Minimum(Staked NFX , EFX Power / 20)
```

## Guardians

A Guardian is a DAO member that can vote on proposals. Guardian play an
important role in the EffectDAO. This comes with the advantage of receiving
rewards in the form of network fees. The specifics on how the rewards are
accumulated and distributed will be discussed in a future chapter.

To become a Guardian you must have at least 1 vote: 1 staked NFX and 20 EFX
Power.

### Commitments

Once the EffectDAO Phase 1 is launched it's important for Guardians to stay in
tune with the voting cycles and changes in the regulations. It's highly
recommended to keep an eye on the [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/hM3237cYXP).

## High Guard

The High Guard is an elected group of Guardians that act as a safe guard before
executing proposals. That have to approve every proposal that is voted in by the
Guardians and have the ability to execute Special Resolutions to make
adjustments to the DAO. This is a security measure to make sure that the DAO
won't be harmed by unknown sources in its early stages.
