## Status

Phase 1 of the DAO will start on the 1st of January 2021. At this moment
[Staking](staking.html) and [Membership](ranks.html) are already functional. Once
Phase 1 is deployed it contains all the primary elements of the DAO. This means
it's possible to register, vote, and create proposals. This wiki will contain up
to date information on the current functioning of the DAO and will be updated to
reflect any changes.
{: .warn}

## Getting started

The EffectDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that is open for
anyone to join. The rules and regulations that govern the DAO as well as its
financials are controlled by smart contracts on the blockchain - this makes the
organization completely transparent for anyone to explore.

### Stake your tokens

[Staking EFX and NFX](staking.html) tokens is the first step in becoming a member of
the DAO. Locking up tokens signals that you will act in best interest of the
project.

### Become a member

To [become a member](ranks.html) you will have to sign the consitution. This is a
relatively easy thing to do [on the dashboard](https://dashboard.effect.ai).
