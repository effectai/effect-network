## Status

Phase 1 of the DAO will start on the 1st of January 2021. At this moment
[Staking](staking) and [Membership](membership) are already fully
functional. Once Phase 1 is deployed it contains all the primary elements of the
DAO. This means it's possible to register, vote, and create proposals. This wiki
will contain up to date information on the current functioning of the DAO and
will be updated to reflect any changes.

## Getting started

The EffectDAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that is open for
anyone to join. The rules and regulations that govern the DAO as well as it's
smart contracts are controlled by smart contracts on the blockchain - this makes
the organization completely transparent and in control by its members.

### Stake your tokens 
Staking EFX and NFX tokens signals that you will act in best interest of the
project and is a requirement for joining the DAO.

### Become a member
The first step in joining the DAO is to become a _Member_. This is a relatively
easy thing to do [on the dashboard](https://dashboard.effect.ai).
