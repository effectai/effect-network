# Getting started as a worker

How to get started as a worker on Effect Network is easy. All you need is a browser with an internet connection. You will also need an EOS account or BSC account. These are needed in order to sign the transactions that are required to use the dApp. You can create an EOS account [here](https://www.eosnation.io/create-account) and a BSC account [here](https://www.binance.org/en/create).

Note that using a bsc account is recomended as a worker, as it is cheaper to use.
