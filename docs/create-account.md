# Create Your Effect Network Account

To post tasks, create qualifications, or complete tasks and get paid on Effect Network, youâ€™ll first need to create an account.
This process is free, and in most cases nearly instant to complete.

## Step One: Start with your blockchain wallet

![Create account](/assets/images/create-account.png){: .d-block .mx-auto }

You can connect to Effect Network by using an EOS or BSC wallet address.
For EOS-based accounts, we recommend Anchor for desktop/mobile and TokenPocket for mobile.
For BSC-based accounts, we recommend using MetaMask.

If you need help/support with creating a wallet address or using any of these services, please visit their official help pages:

- Anchor - [https://support.greymass.com/support/home](https://support.greymass.com/support/home)
- TokenPocket - [https://help.tokenpocket.pro](https://help.tokenpocket.pro/en/)
- MetaMask - [https://metamask.zendesk.com](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/)

Alternately, for those so inclined, you can create a keypair yourself. This is not advised for those who are brand new to blockchain.
